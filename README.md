# ABOUT
Current second-year B.S. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics at Johns Hopkins University, with a second major in Computer Science. At the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute's [Laboratory of Computational Intensive Care Medicine](https://lcicm.jhmi.edu), I work on artificial intelligence and healthcare projects centered around data-driven physiological subphenotype discovery using unsupervised machine learning to better categorize heterogeneity in hospitalized populations.

# PROJECTS
My [website](https://awang124.github.io) showcases several data science projects I completed during the summer of 2024, from most to least recent. Each page corresponds to one project, and contains a general description, code, detailed explanations of procedures and methodologies, and results.
