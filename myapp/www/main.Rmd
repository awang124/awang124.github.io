# ABOUT
Current sophomore at Johns Hopkins University majoring in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and Computer Science. At the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute's [Laboratory of Computational Intensive Care Medicine](https://lcicm.jhmi.edu), I research and develop methods in data-driven physiological phenotype discovery using machine learning and artificial intelligence to better categorize heterogeneity in hospitalized populations. My current work focuses on self-supervised representation learning of clinical time-series data using transformers to predict treatment outcomes in critical care patients.

# PROJECTS
This site's __Projects__ section showcases several data science projects I completed during the summer of 2024, from most to least recent. Each page corresponds to one project, and contains a general description, code, detailed explanations of procedures and methodologies, and results.
